* pdp11

* What is this talk about

- A bit of history

- A bit of evangalism

- A few tips

- A few gotchas

* Disclaimer

This project has very little to do with the real world.

* Why the PDP-11 ?

* Unix

- This is important

- Every computer you interact with today can trace itself back to the work of Ken and Dennis and the architectural style of the PDP-11.

* Yup, Windows as well

The PDP-11 was the predecessor to the VAX-11/780 whos VMS operating system formed the conceptual basis of Windows NT.

* Two simulators

- Started as a Javascript simulator, [http://pdp11.aiju.de/]
- Ported to Go, [https://github.com/davecheney/pdp11]
- Ported to Arduino flavored C++, [https://github.com/davecheney/avr11]

* Why rewrite the simulator in Go ?

Go appears to be an excellent language for writing simulators

- NES
- TRS-80
- ZX Spectrum
- Quite a few 6502 implementations
- (many) LISPs

* The documentation is fantastic

* Time marches on

* Resources, resources, resources

- Bitsavers.org has every user manual, every reference manual, and most of the schematics for all of the DEC PDP line of computers. 

- They also have disk images, tape images, everything you will need

- DEC Diagnostics

* Truth

* 000001

* An example

- MOV

- Takes two operands, source and destination

- Each operand can be a constant, a register, a pointer, or and indirect pointer.

- Encoded as x1SSDD

* An example (cont.)

- Move the lower byte in register 3 to register 4

    MOV R3, R4 110304
    MOV R3, R4 90c4
    MOV R3, R4 37060

* Some drawbacks

    65535
    0xffff
    177777

* A cautionary tail

.play pdp11/oops.go
